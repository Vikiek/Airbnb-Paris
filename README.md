## Author: Wiktoria Ekwi≈Ñska



The open-access dataset on which the analysis was conducted comes from Airbnb platform and it was downloaded via this website: http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html). 
It contains the data, collected from the above mentioned platform, relating to residential homes available for short-term rental from private persons in Paris.


## Goals

From the analysis we want to learn the following:
- in which neighbourhoods the prices per night are the lowest and where are the highest 
- what type of rented property is the cheapest and the most expensive
- are any of the variables correlated
- is there a relationship between the number of reviews (of the property) and its price
- is there a relationship between the availability (of the property) and its price
- what offers are the most popular (=have the highest number of reviews), where they are located and what their availability looks like
- what is the layout of all the listings on the map of Paris, with price and availability demonstration
- what is the layout of the most popular offers on the map of Paris, are they located near tourist attractions
- where are located the most booked offers (= with the lowest availability)
