# Paris Airbnb - visualisation data project in Python 



## Project: [Paris Airbnb](https://Vikiek.github.io/Airbnb-Paris/Airbnb_project.html)

### Author: Wiktoria Ekwińska

The open-access dataset on which the analysis was conducted comes from Airbnb platform and it was downloaded via this website: http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html. 
It contains the data, collected from the above mentioned platform, relating to residential homes available for short-term rental from private persons in Paris.


## Goals

From the analysis we want to learn the following:
- in which neighbourhoods the prices per night are the lowest and where are the highest 
- what type of rented property is the cheapest and the most expensive
- are any of the variables correlated
- is there a relationship between the number of reviews (of the property) and its price
- is there a relationship between the availability (of the property) and its price
- what offers are the most popular (=have the highest number of reviews), where they are located and what their availability looks like
- what is the layout of all the listings on the map of Paris, with price and availability demonstration
- what is the layout of the most popular offers on the map of Paris, are they located near tourist attractions
- where are located the most booked offers (= with the lowest availability)

The project contains some interactive visualisations that were made using Python package - folium.


## Conclusions

- In the dataset there aren't any strong correlations.
- The biggest number of offers is located in Buttes-Montmartre where the average price per night is almost 80 euro.
- The cheapest neighbourhoods for rental (with the average price 70 euro) are Ménilmontant and Buttes-Chaumont where the average availability is also the lowest (there are a lot of bookings in this area).
- The bigggest number of offers with the biggest number of reviews is in Popincourt (the average price for the most popular rentals is 104 euro) and Vaugirard (122 euro on average). The availability of the most popular offers is rather low or moderate and most of these offers have the price in between 50-150 euro per night. The lower the price the more offers with low availability.
- The majority of offers pertains to the rental of the whole property (apartment/home). Their average prices per night are around 92 euro. On the other hand, the most expensive are the hotel rooms with the price 170 euro per night but there are not many hotel room's offers in the dataset. The cheapest are shared rooms where the price is 46 euro on average.
- The majority of the most popular offers is located in some distance from the main tourist attractions in Paris. Besides, more rentals (from the most popular group) can be found in the north area of Paris.
- The highest density of the most booked offers is observed in the north of Paris, with the biggest number of rentals located in the outskirts. The reason for that is the price accessibility of the offers located there.
- The closer to the city centre the more offers with higher prices per night. The number of reviews hardly depends on localisation, the rentals with a high number of reviews can be found in the outskirts as well as in the city centre.
